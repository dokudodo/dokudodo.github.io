This means setting goals for yourself, figuring out what type of workout you want to do, and creating a schedule that works for you. Here are some steps to get started:</p><ol><li>Set realistic goals for yourself. Do you want to gain a certain amount of weight in a certain amount of time?</li><li>Choose a type of workout that works for you. This could be weight lifting, cardio, or a combination of both.</li><li>Create a workout schedule that you can stick to. This might mean working out a certain number of days per week, or working out for a certain amount of time each day.</li><li>Track your progress. Keep a log of your workouts and your weight gain, so that you can see how far you've come.</li></ol><h3 id="part2">How Long Should You Workout to Build Muscle?</h3><p>If your goal is to build muscle and gain weight, you'll need to do longer workouts than someone who is just trying to maintain their current weight.

These are exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses.</li><li>Gradually increase the weight you're lifting. This will help you build strength and muscle over time.</li><li>Don't forget about cardio. While weight lifting is important for building muscle, cardio is important for overall health and fitness.</li></ol><h3 id="part4">Solutions for Gaining Weight through Exercise</h3><p>If you're struggling to gain weight through exercise, there are a few solutions you can try:</p><ol><li>Work with a personal trainer. A trainer can help you create a workout plan that is tailored to your specific goals and needs.</li><li>Try a weight gain supplement.
