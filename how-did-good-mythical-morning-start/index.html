The duo has been making videos together since their college days in North Carolina, but it wasn't until 2012 that they launched their daily morning show that has now amassed over 16 million subscribers and 7.5 billion views. In this article, we'll take a closer look at how Good Mythical Morning started, its format, segments, guests, controversies, behind-the-scenes, spin-offs, impact, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p><h2 id="section2">The Beginning of Rhett and Link</h2><p>Rhett and Link met in first grade and became best friends. They attended the same high school and later the same college, where they formed a comedy troupe called "I Love Local Commercials". After graduation, they moved to Los Angeles to pursue their dream of becoming entertainers. They landed various gigs, including writing and performing songs for TV commercials, but they still struggled to gain recognition.</p><p>It wasn't until they started making videos for YouTube in 2006 that they gained a cult following. Their quirky humor, musical talents, and unique brand of storytelling resonated with viewers. They created several popular series, such as "The Man Song", "Rub Some Bacon on It", and "Epic Rap Battle: Nerd vs. Geek". They also collaborated with other YouTubers, such as Smosh, Freddie Wong, and Hannah Hart.</p><h2 id="section3">The Birth of Good Mythical Morning</h2><p>In January 2012, Rhett and Link launched Good Mythical Morning as a daily morning talk show. The idea was to have a show where they could do whatever they wanted, be themselves, and interact with their fans. The show quickly gained traction, thanks to its unique blend of humor, games, challenges, experiments, and food reviews. The show's tagline, "Good Mythical Morning - the show that's everything but a morning show", reflected its irreverent and unpredictable nature.</p><p>The show's initial format was simple. Rhett and Link would sit at a table and talk about random topics, such as weird news stories, pop culture trends, and personal anecdotes.
