Vegetables are low in calories and high in nutrients, making them an excellent choice for weight loss. Choose a mix of leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, and colorful peppers and tomatoes.</p><h3>Step 4: Add Flavor</h3><p>Finally, add some flavor to your meal with herbs, spices, or a healthy sauce or dressing.
