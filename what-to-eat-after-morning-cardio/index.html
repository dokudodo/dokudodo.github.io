Eating the right foods after your workout provides your body with the nutrients it needs to repair these tears and build stronger muscles. Finally, post-workout nutrition can help to reduce muscle soreness and fatigue. Eating a meal that\u0027s high in protein and carbohydrates can help to reduce inflammation and promote recovery. \u003ch2 id=\u0022sec2\u0022\u003eSection 2: What to Eat After Morning Cardio\u003c\/h2\u003e So, what should you eat after your morning cardio workout?
