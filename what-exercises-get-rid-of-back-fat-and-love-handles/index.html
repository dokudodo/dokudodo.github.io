Here are some of the best strength training exercises to target your back and love handles:</p><h3>1. Pull-Ups</h3><p>Pull-ups are an excellent exercise for targeting your back muscles. They require a lot of upper body strength, but there are modifications you can make to make them easier. Try using a resistance band or doing assisted pull-ups until you build up your strength.</p><h3>2. Bent-Over Rows</h3><p>Bent-over rows are another great exercise for targeting your back muscles. They can be done with dumbbells or a barbell, and you can vary the weight to make the exercise more challenging. Keep your back straight and engage your core to get the most out of this exercise.</p><h3>3. Russian Twists</h3><p>Russian twists are an effective exercise for targeting your love handles.

Stay Hydrated</h3><p>Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help flush out toxins and keep your body hydrated. Avoid sugary drinks and alcohol, as they can dehydrate you.</p><h2 id="tips">Additional Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you get the most out of your workout:</p><h3>1.

This can help prevent injury and improve your overall performance.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>1.
