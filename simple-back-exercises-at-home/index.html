You can also try some gentle stretches to loosen up your muscles.</p><h3>Intensity</h3><p>Start with exercises that are easy and gradually work your way up to more challenging ones. You can increase the intensity by adding more reps, sets, or resistance. However, don't overdo it and stop if you feel any pain or discomfort.</p><h3>Pain and Discomfort</h3><p>If any exercise causes pain or discomfort, stop immediately. You may need to modify the exercise or seek medical advice if the pain persists.</p><h3>Breathing and Breaks</h3><p>Breathe normally throughout the exercise and take breaks as needed.
